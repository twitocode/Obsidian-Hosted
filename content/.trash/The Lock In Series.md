description: "This discounted ebundle of the Lock In Series: includes: Lock In, Head On, Unlocked &quot;This is the kind of thriller that Michael Crichton, Lincoln Child, and James Rollins do so well. Add John Scalzi to that list.&quot; --Douglas Preston A blazingly inventive near-future thriller series from the best-selling, Hugo Award-winning John Scalzi. Not too long from today, a new, highly contagious virus makes its way across the globe. Most who get sick experience nothing worse than flu, fever and headaches. But for the unlucky one percent -- and nearly five million souls in the United States alone -- the disease causes &quot;Lock In&quot;: Victims fully awake and aware, but unable to move or respond to stimulus. The disease affects young, old, rich, poor, people of every color and creed. The world changes to meet the challenge. At the Publisher's request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied."
