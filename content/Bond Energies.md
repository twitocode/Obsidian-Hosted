**Bond dissociation Energy**: the quantity of energy required to break a chemical bond. Measured in $kJ/mol$

> [!Info]
> They are **measured in averages** because the bond energy of a bond is affected by the number of atoms and bonds around it. Using an an average is more convient

### Trends in Bond Energies
1. Multiple bonds are generally stronger than single bonds
2. As the number of bonds increases, the bond length shortens

# What happens in a reaction?
1. The bonds in the reactants break first. For bonds to be broken, energy must be added (endothermic). 
2. Then new bonds are made in the products which releases energy (exothermic)

$\Delta H=$ 
	sum of energies required to break old bonds **-** 
	sum of energies released in the formation of new bonds

energy required is the reactants bond energies and energy released is the products bond energies
$n$ is the amount in moles of each reactant or product
