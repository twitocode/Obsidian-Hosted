# Why does the [[Thermal Energy|temperature]] not change during phase changes? #flashcard
[[Thermal energy]] is being transformed into [[Energy|Chemical Potential Energy]] to make or break bonds, not [[Mechanical Energy|Kinetic Energy]], therefore, **the [[Thermal Energy|temperature]] does not change.**

- **Melting and boiling**: [[thermal energy]] absorbed by the particles of a substance is converted to [[Energy|Chemical Potential Energy]] to break the bonds that hold the particles together
- **Condensation and freezing**: [[thermal energy]] is released to allow the particles to move closer together and become more organized
