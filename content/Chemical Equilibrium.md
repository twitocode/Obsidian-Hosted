The phenomenon that occurs when the rate of the forward reaction equals the rate of the reverse reaction. The concentration of all participants stays the same.

In this example. $\ce{[HI_{(g)}]}$ is initially zero
$\ce{[H_{2}_{(g)}}]$ and $\ce{[I_{2}_{(g)}]}$ decrease as they react to produce $\ce{[HI_{(g)}]}$ (Forward Reaction)
- As $\ce{[HI_{(g)}]}$ increases, more of these molecules will collide to make $\ce{H_{2}}$ and $\ce{I_{2}}$ molecules (Reverse Reaction)
	- Eventually a point is reached where the **rate of the forward reaction** = **rate of the reverse reaction** and the concentrations of all participants remains unchanged.

### Characteristics 
1. **There is some amount of every reactant and product present in the system at equilibrium**
2. The system is dynamic *at the microscopic level* because both forward and reverse reactions are going on at the same time. The system is at equilibrium because the 
   **rate of the forward reaction** = **rate of the reverse reaction**
3. *At the macroscopic level*, the system does not change (eg. colour, pressure, volume, temperature, concentration)
4. The system must be closed

# Stress
A change in the environmental conditions of a system ex. Adding heat
## Le Chatelier's Principle
**When an equilibrium is subject to stress, the system reacts to this stress in an attempt to minimize it** (since the system is temporarily unbalanced). This stress cannot be entirely removed but if it is not too great, the system may "settle down" into a new equilibrium state.

### Factors which Affect a System at Equilibrium
- Concentration changes
- Temperature changes
- Pressure/Volume changes (gaseous systems only)
- Catalysts
- Addition of an inert gas
