The phenomenon that occurs when the rate of the forward reaction equals the rate of the reverse reaction. The concentration of all participants stays the same.

In this example. $\ce{[HI_{(g)}]}$ is initially zero
$\ce{[H_{2}_{(g)}}]$ and $\ce{[I_{2}_{(g)}]}$ decrease as they react to produce $\ce{[HI_{(g)}]}$ (Forward Reaction)
- As $\ce{[HI_{(g)}]}$ increases, more of these molecules will collide to make $\ce{H_{2}}$ and $\ce{I_{2}}$ molecules (Reverse Reaction)
	- Eventually a point is reached where the **rate of the forward reaction** = **rate of the reverse reaction** and the concentrations of all participants remains unchanged.

### Characteristics 
1. **There is some amount of every reactant and product present in the system at equilibrium**
2. The system is dynamic *at the microscopic level* because both forward and reverse reactions are going on at the same time. The system is at equilibrium because the 
   **rate of the forward reaction** = **rate of the reverse reaction**
3. *At the macroscopic level*, the system does not change (eg. colour, pressure, volume, temperature, concentration)
4. The system must be closed

# Stress
A change in the environmental conditions of a system ex. Adding heat
## Le Chatelier's Principle
**When an equilibrium is subject to stress, the system reacts to this stress in an attempt to minimize it** (since the system is temporarily unbalanced). This stress cannot be entirely removed but if it is not too great, the system may "settle down" into a new equilibrium state.

### Factors which Affect a System at Equilibrium
- Concentration changes
- Temperature changes
- Pressure/Volume changes (gaseous systems only)
- Catalysts
- Addition of an inert gas

#### Concentration Change

$$\ce{Fe^{3+}_{(aq)} + SCN-_{(aq)} <=> FeSCN^{2+}_{(aq)}}$$
How does increasing $\ce{[SCN-_{(aq)}]}$ affect the equilibrium

Single step mechanism:
$\text{rate}_{\text{(forward)}} = k_1 \ce{[Fe^{3+}_{(aq)}] [SCN-_{(aq)}] }$
$\text{rate}_{\text{(reverse)}}= k_1 \ce{[FeSCN^{2+}_{(aq)}] }$

Le Chatelier's principle predicts that the forward reaction will take over when $\ce{[SCN-_{(aq)}]}$ is increased. 
- In terms of rate theory, $\ce{[SCN-_{(aq)}]}$ is a term that is found only in the rate law of the forward reaction. If $\ce{[SCN-_{(aq)}]}$ is increased, the forward rate will increase instantaneously with no corresponding increase in the rate of the reverse reaction. Since $rate_{\text{(forward)}} > rate_{\text{(reverse)}}$, the forward reaction takes over.
- As time progresses, $\ce{[Fe^{3}+_{(aq)}]}$ and $\ce{[SCN-_{(aq)}]}$ drop,   $\ce{[FeSCN^{2+}_{(aq)}]}$  increases, and the reverse reaction dominates. Eventually, both rates will be equal and a new equilibrium will exist.
#### Temperature change
$$\ce{H2(g) + I2(g) <=> 2HI(g)} \quad \Delta H > 0$$
Or
$$\ce{heat + H2(g) + I2(g) <=> 2HI(g)}$$
1. If the temperature is increased
	- The system will react so as to remove as as much heat as possible. the forward reaction converts the additional heat into stored energy therefore this reaction takes over. The equilibrium shifts to the right and $$\ce{[HI] \text{increases}, [H_{2}] \text{decreases}, [I_{2}] \text{decreases}}$$
2. If the temperature is decreased
	- The reverse reaction will take over. This reaction can replace the removed heat by shifting the reaction to the left
#### Pressure or Volume change


#### Catalysts

#### Addition of Inert Gas
