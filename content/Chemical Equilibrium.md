The phenomenon that occurs when the rate of the forward reaction equals the rate of the reverse reaction. The concentration of all participants stays the same.

In this example. $\ce{[HI_{(g)}]}$ is initially zero
$\ce{[H_{2}_{(g)}}]$ and $\ce{[I_{2}_{(g)}]}$ decrease as they react to produce $\ce{[HI_{(g)}]}$ (Forward Reaction)
- As $\ce{[HI_{(g)}]}$ increases, more of these molecules will collide to make $\ce{H_{2}}$ and $\ce{I_{2}}$ molecules (Reverse Reaction)
	- Eventually a point is reached where the **rate of the forward reaction** = **rate of the reverse reaction** and the concentrations of all participants remains unchanged.

### Characteristics 
1. **There is some amount of every reactant and product present in the system at equilibrium**
2. The system is dynamic at the microscopic level because both forward and reverse reactions are going on at the same time. The system is at equilibrium because the rate of the forward reaction is equal to the rate of the revers reaction
3. At the macroscopic level, the system does not change (eg. colour, pressure, volume, temperature, concentration)
4. The system must be closed
