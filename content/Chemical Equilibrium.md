The phenomenon that occurs when the rate of the forward reaction equals the rate of the reverse reaction. The concentration of all participants stays the same.

In this example. $\ce{[HI_{(g)}]}$ is initially zero
$\ce{[H_{2}_{(g)}}]$ and $\ce{[I_{2}_{(g)}]}$ decrease as they react to produce $\ce{[HI_{(g)}]}$ (Forward Reaction)
- As $\ce{[HI_{(g)}]}$ increases, more of these molecules will collide to make $\ce{H_{2}}$ and $\ce{I_{2}}$ molecules (Reverse Reaction)
	- Eventually a point is reached where the **rate of the forward reaction** = **rate of the reverse reaction** and the concentrations of all participants remains unchanged.

### Characteristics 
1. There is some amount of every reactant and product present in the system at equilibrium
