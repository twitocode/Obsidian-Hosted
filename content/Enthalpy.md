Also known as [[Thermal Energy]]. It is the sum of all Potential Energy and Kinetic Energy associated with particles of matter.

$H = E_K + E_P$

> [!NOTE]
> Potential energy is the energy stored within the particles and the bonds that hold them together.
> Kinetic energy is energy associated with the movement of particles
> ---
> *As Kinetic energy increases, Potential Energy decreases, vice versa*


$\Delta H$ or heat is the amount of [[Thermal Energy]] transferred between substances during a physical, chemical or nuclear change.

If $\Delta H > 0$ then the reaction is endothermic, meaning it releases heat
If $\Delta H < 0$ then the reaction is exothermic, meaning it absorbed heat


> [!NOTE] 
> Enthalpy is only for a **Chemical System**, which is a group of reactants and products being studied. Surroundings may be in contact with the system but we're not counting $\Delta H$ for it

## Calorimetry
A process by which the energy changes of a system can be measured. 
**Calorimeter**: a device that can measure $\Delta H$

$$\Delta H = mc\Delta T$$
$c$ is the [[Heat|Specific Heat Capacity]] of a substance

$$q_{\text{absorbed}} = m_{water}\cdot c_{water}\cdot\Delta T$$
$$q_{\text{transfered}} = -q_{\text{absorbed}}$$

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The energy absorbed by the water which is considered a surrounding, is equal to the $-\Delta H$
> Dont forget to reverse $\Delta H$

To find the energy released per mole of a reactant or product, find the mass --> molar mass --> moles of the compound, then do a mole-energy ratio.

$n = CV$
$n = \frac{m}{MM}$
