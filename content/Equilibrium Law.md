$$k_{eq} = \frac{[\text{products}]}{\text{[reactants]}}$$

Example: $\ce{2A(g) + B(g) <=> 3C(s) + D(g)}$
$$k_{eq} = \frac{[C]^3[D]}{[A]^2[B]}$$
- The coefficients from the balanced chemical equation becomes the exponent of the concentration in the equilibrium law.

## Using it in practice
The following equilibrium concentrations were obtained at 490 degrees
$$
\begin{align*}
[\ce{H2}] &= 8.62 \times 10^{-2} \ \mathrm{mol/L} \\
[\ce{I2}] &= 2.63 \times 10^{-1} \ \mathrm{mol/L} \\
[\ce{HI}] &= 1.02 \ \mathrm{mol/L}
\end{align*}
$$

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> Only equilibrium concentrations can be substituted into equilibrium law

$$K_{eq} = \frac{[\ce{HI}]^2}{[\ce{H2}][\ce{I2}]}$$
$$= \frac{(1.02 \ \mathrm{mol/L})^2}{(8.62 \times 10^{-2} \ \mathrm{mol/L})(2.63 \times 10^{-1} \ \mathrm{mol/L})}$$

$$=45.9$$
$K_{eq} = 45.9$ which means that there is 45.9x more product than reactant *at this temperature*.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In this example, there is no unit because the mol/L cancel out. BUT there will never be one unit for the equilibrium constant.

Since
$$K_{eq} = \frac{[\ce{HI}]^2}{[\ce{H2}][\ce{I2}]}$$
Then
$$
\begin{align*}
45.9 &= \frac{(2n)^2}{(1.00-n)(1.00-n)} \\
45.9 &= \frac{(2n)^2}{(1.00-n)^2} \\
\sqrt{45.9} &= \frac{2n}{1.00-n} \\
6.77(1.00 - n) &= 2n \\
6.77 - 6.77n &= 2n \\
6.77 &= 8.77n \\
0.77 &= n
\end{align*}
$$
Therefore
$$\begin{align*}
[\ce{H2_{(g)}}] &= [\ce{I2_{(g)}}] = 1.00 - 0.77 \\
&= 0.23 \ \mathrm{mol/L}
\end{align*}
$$
and
$$
\begin{align*}
[\ce{HI_{(g)}}] &= 2(0.77) \\
&= 1.54 \ \mathrm{mol/L}
\end{align*}$$

## Significance of different $K_{eq}$ values
$$\ce{A + B <=> C + D}$$ $$K_{eq} = \frac{[C][D]}{[A][B]}$$If $K_{eq}$​ is very large, the equilibrium must lie far to the right since product concentrations must be greater than reactant concentrations for the numerator to be greater than the denominator in the equilibrium law.

If $K_{eq}​$ is very small, the equilibrium must lie far to the left since reactant concentrations must be greater than the product concentrations for the denominator to be greater than the numerator in the equilibrium law.

When $K_{eq}$​ = 1, the equilibrium does not lie in any particular direction because the reactant concentrations must be very close to the product concentrations.
