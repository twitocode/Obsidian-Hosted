A measure of how fast a reaction is taking place
The unit is $\frac{mol \cdot s}{L}$

$$Rate \space  \alpha \space[concentration]$$
$$Rate = \frac{\Delta concentration}{\Delta time}$$
concentration is either appearing (positive) or dissapearing(negative)

**Chemical Kinetics**: the study of ways to make chemical reactions go faster or slower.

### Reaction Co-ordinate Diagram for the Formation of HBr
![[Reaction Coordinate diagram for the formation of HBr.excalidraw|800]]


> [!NOTE] Section A
> Both gases are in random motion and have a large quantity of kinetic energy
> Total potential energy stays the same because they are no where no each other


> [!NOTE] Section B
> 1. Both molecules slow down when they approach each other because of the repulsive forces between molecules
> 2. Kinetic is transformed in Potential
> 3. Molecules stretch as the nonpolar covalent bonds within each molecule weaken
> 	- This causes a large amount of energy to be absorbed


> [!NOTE] Section C
> **Activated Complex**: a high energy, short lived intermediate configuration of reactant atoms. 
> - May decompose and form new lower energy stable products OR revert to the original reactant molecules
