A measure of how fast a reaction is taking place
The unit is $\frac{mol \cdot s}{L}$

$$Rate \space  \alpha \space[concentration]$$
$$Rate = \frac{\Delta concentration}{\Delta time}$$
concentration is either appearing (positive) or dissapearing(negative)

**Chemical Kinetics**: the study of ways to make chemical reactions go faster or slower.
