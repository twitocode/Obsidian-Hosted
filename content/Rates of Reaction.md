A measure of how fast a reaction is taking place
The unit is $\frac{mol \cdot s}{L}$


$$Rate \space  \alpha \space[concentration]$$
$$Rate = \frac{\Delta concentration}{\Delta time}$$
concentration is either appearing (positive) or dissapearing(negative)

**Properties like mass, colour, volume, and pressure can be monitored** to detect the amount (in mol) of reactant which disappears, or the amount of product that appears during a specific time interval.

**Activation Energy $E_{A}$**: the minimal starting energy (as $E_k$ changes to $E_P$) that the reactant molecules must have in order to undergo and *effective collision* and produce a reaction

**Effective Collisions** occur when the two colliding particles have enough $E_k$ and $E_P$ to overcome repulsive forces between positive nuclei and negative electron clouds.
- If the collision is effective, then old bonds break, and new bonds form

> [!NOTE] Section A
> Both gases are in random motion and have a large quantity of kinetic energy
> Total potential energy stays the same because they are no where no each other

> [!NOTE] Section B
> 1. Both molecules slow down when they approach each other because of the repulsive forces between molecules
> 2. Kinetic is transformed in Potential
> 3. Molecules stretch as the nonpolar covalent bonds within each molecule weaken
> 	- This causes a large amount of energy to be absorbed

> [!NOTE] Section C
> **Activated Complex**: a high energy, short lived intermediate configuration of reactant atoms. 
> - May decompose and form new lower energy stable products OR revert to the original reactant molecules

> [!NOTE] Section D
> 1. H-Br molecules form, energy is released since bonds are forming. 
> 2. Potential drops and Kinetic increases
> 	- Molecules speed up and move away from each other

# Collision Rate Theory
for a reaction to occur, two particles must collide. Reactants must also have enough kinetic energy and collide at a certain orientation.
