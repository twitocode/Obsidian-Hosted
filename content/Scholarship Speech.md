**Good evening, everyone.**

I am truly honored to receive the **John C. Holland STEM Scholarship.** Thank you to the **Hamilton Black History Council** and the incredible community that makes this event possible.

I have always has a passion in computer science and engineering, but opportunities like this remind me that I’m not on this journey alone. To my **parents, siblings, friends, and teachers**—your support has been invaluable.

Reverend John C. Holland’s legacy teaches us to break barriers and lift others as we climb. This scholarship is not just an award but a responsibility—to innovate, inspire, and pave the way for future generations in STEM.

I am excited for what’s ahead, and I promise to make the most of this opportunity.

**Thank you!**
