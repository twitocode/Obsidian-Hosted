When all of the solute in a solution is fully dissolved (fully saturated), the solution is in a state of heterogenous equilibrium. 

$$
K_{eq} = \frac{[\ce{K+(aq)}]^2[\ce{Cr2O7^2-(aq)}]}{[\ce{K2Cr2O7(s)}]}
$$
$$
\ce{K2Cr2O7(s) <=> 2K+(aq) + Cr2O7^2-(aq)}
$$In this example, $\ce{K2Cr2O7(s)}$ is the solid, and therefore has a constant concentration because this is a heterogenous equilibrium. 

$$K_{sp} = [\ce{K+(aq)}]^2[\ce{Cr2O7^2-(aq)}$$
**Solubility Product Constant:** This is the product of the solubilities of each ion in the solution.

1. If it is very large
   Equilibrium lies far to the right and prefers the forward reaction
2. If it is very small
   Equilibrium lies far to the left and prefers the reverse reaction.

# Molar Solubility for **Salts**
The amount of solute (salt) dissolved in 1.0L of its saturated solution

> [!NOTE]
> **Salts** are any ionic compound that doesn't contain $\ce{OH-}$ or $\ce{O^{2=}}$
> 
> Ex. $\ce{AgCl}$ and $\ce{PbI2}$




Here's the text with chemistry notation using LaTeX:

**Let x represent the molar solubility of lead(II) iodide.**

$$\ce{PbI2 (s) <=> Pb^2+(aq) + 2I-(aq)}$$

| $\ce{PbI2 (s)}$ | $\ce{Pb^2+(aq) }$ | $\ce{2I-(aq)}$ |
| --------------- | ----------------- | -------------- |
| ↓x              | ↑x                | ↑2x            |

$$\begin{align*} K_{sp} &= [\ce{Pb^2+(aq)}][\ce{I-(aq)}]^2 \\ K_{sp} &= (x)(2x)^2 \\ K_{sp} &= 4x^3 \\ K_{sp} &= 8.5 \times 10^{-9} \ \mathrm{(mol/L)^3} \quad \text{(from table on page 802 in text)} \end{align*}$$

**therefore,**

$$
\begin{align*}
8.5 \times 10^{-9} &= 4x^3 \\
2.0\times 10^{-9} &= x^3 \\
1.3 \times 10^{-3} &= x
\end{align*}
$$

**Therefore the molar solubility of plumbous iodide is 1.3 x 10⁻³ mol/L.**

This will render the chemical formulas and equations correctly.
